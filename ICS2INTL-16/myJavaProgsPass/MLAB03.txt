a) while Loop
b) for Loop
c) do-while Loop

8.
a) while loop
The body of the loop or statements under the while-loop will be
repeatedly executed while the condition is TRUE. Otherwise, the loop will
terminate and the next statement after the end of the while loop will be
executed next.

b)for loop
The for-loop is actually a “more compact” form of the while loop. The
loop is executed as follows:
1. Perform the initialization
2. Check the condition
3. If the condition results to a TRUE value, the statement/s inside the forloop
(body) will be executed. Else proceed to #6
4. Change of state
5. Goes back to #2.
6. Exit the loop and the statement after the end of the for-loop will be
executed. 

c)do-while loop
The Do-While is executed as follows:
1. Performs the initialization.
2. Performs the body of the loop
3. Change of state
4. Checks the condition. If the condition results to a TRUE value, the
statement/s inside the do-while Loop (body) will be executed until
condition will be FALSE.
5. If condition is FALSE, exit the loop and the statement after the end of
the do-while Loop will be executed.

9.
the difference between these loops are how to input the count of loops or the codes for the loops.
