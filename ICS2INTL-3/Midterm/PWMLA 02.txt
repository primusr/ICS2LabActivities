3.4

Input a number from 1 to 7: 5
The day is a Friday!
Have a nice day.

**

4.2 

Input a number from 1 to 7: 90
Invalid input!!!
Have a nice day.

**

4.3

Input a number from 1 to 7: 2
The day is a Tuesday!
The day is a Wednesday!
Have a nice day.

EFFECT OF REMOVING THE BREAK STATEMENT:
The program continues to do the statements for the next case in the switch statement. In this case, it continues to do the statements for case 3 which is to print "The day is a Wednesday!". Thus, it shows two outputs.

In terms of writability, the cascading if-else statement is better since the statements are shorter are compared to switch statement. However, in terms of readability, the switch statement is better. As opposed to if-else statement, the switch statement can be easily understood because of its format. Additionally, the if-else statements are much complex to be read and understood since it uses a lot of conditional operators like || or ==.


** SWITCH STATEMENTS **

import java.util.*;

public class Quarter{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter an integer value from 1 to 12: ");
		int month = in.nextInt();

		switch(month){

			case 1:
			case 2:
			case 3:	System.out.println("1st Quarter");
				break;

			case 4:
			case 5:
			case 6:	System.out.println("2nd Quarter");
				break;

			case 7:
			case 8:
			case 9:	System.out.println("3rd Quarter");
				break;

			case 10:
			case 11:
			case 12: System.out.println("4th Quarter");
				 break;

		}
	}	
}

** CASCADING IF-ELSE STATEMENTS **

import java.util.*;

public class Quarter{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Enter an integer value from 1 to 12: ");
		int month = in.nextInt();

		if (month == 1 || month == 2 || month == 3)
			System.out.println("1st Quarter");

		else if (month == 4 || month == 5 || month == 6)
			System.out.println("2nd Quarter");

		else if (month == 7 || month == 8 || month == 9)
			System.out.println("3rd Quarter");

		else
			System.out.println("4th Quarter");
