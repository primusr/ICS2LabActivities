6. The main objective of these programs is to test if there is differences in while, for and do loop.
 
7.while Loop
  for loop
  do-while loop

8. Counter is a variable that is being used to keep on tracking the count of a certain group of items. Sometimes its data is an integer, which is initialized to a value of zero 0 and incremented by 1 inside a loop.

9. Checking the condition. If the condition results to a TRUE value, the statement insde the do-while loop will be executed until the condition says FALSE, and if the condition is FALSE, exit the loop and the statement after the end of the do-while loop will be executed.
The for-loop is known as a "more compact" form of the while loop.
