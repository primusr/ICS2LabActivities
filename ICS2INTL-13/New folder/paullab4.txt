In the central processing unit, or CPU, of a computer, the accumulator acts as a special register that stores values and increments of intermediate arithmetic and logic calculations. The accumulator is a temporary memory location that is accessed speedily by the CPU.

7.
Accumulator holds the arithmetic and logical data inside the CPU.
It can also called as register which stores the data temporarily.
