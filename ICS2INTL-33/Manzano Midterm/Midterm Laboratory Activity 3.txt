3.4.
	Input starting number: 1
	Input ending number: 5
	Sum = 9

4.1
	Input starting number: 1
	Input ending number: 5
	Sum = 9

5.1
	Input starting number: 1
	Input ending number: 5
	Sum = 9

	These programs are used to do repeated task or anything that needs to be parsed from start to end

	while loop
	Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

	for loop
	Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

	do...while loop
	Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

8.
	The while and do/while loops both follow the same basic flowchart. The only exception is that:
	In a while loop, the expression is tested first
	In a do/while loop, the loop "body" is executed first

9
	The do while loop executes the content of the loop once before checking the condition of the while.
	A while loop will check the condition first before executing the content.
