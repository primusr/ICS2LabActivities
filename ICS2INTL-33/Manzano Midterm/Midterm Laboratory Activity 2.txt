Midterm Laboratory Activity 2


3.4
3
The Day is Wednesday!
Have a Nice Day.


4.2
Input a number from 1 to 7: 
8
Invalid Input!!!
Have a Nice Day.


4.3
Input a number from 1 to 7: 
2
The Day is Tuesday!
The Day is Wednesday!
Have a Nice Day.

The next statement is included because without the break statement the loop will not be terminated. 


4.5
Did your program behave normally? (YES)
Does it really matter where you place the default? (NO)


4.6
Did your program behave normally? (YES)
Is there any effect on the program behavior? (NONE)


5.3
Switch is generally faster than a long list of ifs because the compiler can generate a jump table. The longer the list, the better a switch statement is over a series of if statements
