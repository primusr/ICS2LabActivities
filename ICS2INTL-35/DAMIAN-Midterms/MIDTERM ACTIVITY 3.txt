MIDTERM ACTIVITY 3

3.2. Save the program as Sum1.java then compile your program until
no errors and warnings are reported.
3.3. Run your program.
3.4. Simulate and write what will be displayed on the screen.
	- Input Starting number: 1
	  Input Ending number : 5
	  Sum = 9

4.1. Simulate and write what will be displayed on the screen. Try using
the same input values in your Sum1.java
	- Input Starting number: 1
	  Input Ending number : 5
	  Sum = 9

5.1. Simulate and write what will be displayed on the screen. Try using
the same input values in your Sum1.java and Sum2.java
	- Input Starting number: 1
	  Input Ending number : 5
	  Sum = 9
6. After your simulation for the three programs, what do you think is the main
objective of these programs?
	 - To compute the sum of the numbers in between the starting number and the ending number.

7. Identify what are the different loop control structures in Java.
	- For Loop , While Loop , and Do-while Loop.

8. What are the usual similar components of these loop-constructs?
	-All loops perform the code repeatedly as long as the condition that is being evaluated is true.

9. What do you think is different among these identified loop constructs?
Justify your answer.
	- While Loop checks for the condition first, so if the condition is false it will not enter the loop
	- For Loop will execute the statement every iteration in the loop.
	-  Do-while Loop execute the statements first before checking the condition.

10.Create a complete Java program that shall allow the user to accept three
integer values representing the START, END, and STEP respectively. The
START should always be lesser than the END value, and the STEP is
always greater than zero. The program shall print vertically the values
starting from the START to the last value which can be equal to or lesser
than the END incremented by the STEP value.
