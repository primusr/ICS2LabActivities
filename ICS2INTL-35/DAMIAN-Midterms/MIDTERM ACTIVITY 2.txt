	What is the effect of removing the break statement?
	- The case that will be print out is the chosen case and the next case because the statement didnt break so 
	the program thinks it is part of the chosen case.

4.5
	Compile,run your program. Try inputting a value that is not from 1 to 7.

	Did your program behave normally? (YES)
	Does it really matter where you place the default? (NO)
4.6
	Try rearranging the case values in a randomize manner.Compile and run your program.
	
	Did your program behave normally? (YES)
	Is there any effect on the program behavior? (NONE)
5.3
	
	-For me the switch-case statement is easier to write and understand because in the if-else statements you need to specify the range of the
	number per statement unlike in the Switch-case statement you can just write the case number and thats it.
