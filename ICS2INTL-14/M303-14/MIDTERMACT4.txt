the purpose of the accumulator is to act as a special register that store values and increments of intermediate arithmetic and logic calculations, It is also a temporary memory location that is accessed speedily by the CPU

the difference between counter and accumulator is that couter is a variable that is used to keep track of the count of a certain group of items while accumulator is a variable that is used to keep track of the accumulated value of a certain group of items.
